            <p>Section I: PREAMBLE
                The rapid adoption of stable diffusion based models has led to an explosion of custom models trained and published to public model repositories such as HuggingFace and CivitAi. We provide access to run inferences using any model publicly available on these websites. The base Stable Diffusion allows the generation of NSFW images, as well as a mechanism to detect NSFW content. Additionally, many users of HuggingFace or CivitAi have trained custom models specifically tailored to generate NSFW content.
                This raises many important considerations regarding the ethical and potentially harmful use of AI to generate NSFW content. As the base Stable Diffusion (HuggingFace) allows turning off the NSFW safety checks, we also allow the user to opt-in to using NSFW models and viewing NSFW content generated by other users on our platform.
                This document sets boundaries of responsibility regarding the use of NSFW content and models on our site.
                NOW THEREFORE, You and HappyAccidents Inc. agree as follows:
                1. Definitions
                "Policy" means the terms and conditions for use the NSFW feature of HappyAccidents as defined in this document.

                "NSFW Content" means any content that could be considered pornographic, violent, harmful, or otherwise not safe for work, produced by You or any other user of HappyAccidents using the HappyAccidents platform, regardless of whether it was produced using an NSFW Model or not.
                "NSFW Model" means a model known to us ahead of time as being specifically intended to generate NSFW content. Note that many models (including base StableDiffusion) may be used to generate NSFW Output but are not specifically intended for this purpose and so are not included in this definition.
                "NSFW Mode" refers to an opt-in Account Setting that user has explicitly enabled to receive access to NSFW Models, see NSFW Content, and generate NSFW Output.
                "Third Party Models" refers to any Stable Diffusion based Model, LORA, etc which is hosted and on a third party site such as HuggingFace, CivitAi, et al, and that is made available for use on HappyAccidents.
